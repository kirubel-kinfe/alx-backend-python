# ALX Backend Python: Unit Tests and Integration Tests

## Overview

This project is part of the ALX Backend Python curriculum, focusing on unit testing and integration testing in Python. It aims to build proficiency in writing robust tests to ensure code reliability and correctness. The tasks involve creating unit tests for utility functions, such as those in `utils.py`, and potentially integration tests for other modules like `client.py`, using testing patterns such as parameterization, mocking, and fixtures.

## Repository

- **GitHub Repository**: `alx-backend-python`
- **Directory**: `0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests`

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Understand the difference between unit tests and integration tests.
- Apply common testing patterns, including:
  - **Mocking**: Isolating functions by mocking external dependencies.
  - **Parameterization**: Testing multiple input scenarios efficiently.
  - **Fixtures**: Setting up reusable test data.
- Write type-annotated Python functions and tests that adhere to `pycodestyle` (version 2.5).
- Create comprehensive documentation for modules, classes, and functions.

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **Python 3.7**.
- Files must start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- All files must end with a newline.
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.5) standards.
- All modules, classes, and functions must have documentation (verifiable via `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'` and similar commands).
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- All files must be executable.

## Files

- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions, such as `access_nested_map`, to be tested.
- **test_utils.py**: Contains unit tests for functions in `utils.py`, including parameterized tests for `access_nested_map`.
- **client.py**: Contains client-related code (may be used in later tasks).
- **fixtures.py**: Provides test fixtures for integration tests (may be used in later tasks).
- **README.md**: This file, describing the project.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/alx-backend-python.git
   cd alx-backend-python/0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests
   ```

2. Ensure Python 3.7 and required packages are installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3.7
   pip install parameterized
   ```

3. Make all files executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.py
   ```

## Running Tests

To execute the unit tests, run:
```bash
python -m unittest test_utils.py
```

This command discovers and runs all test cases in `test_utils.py`, including tests for the `access_nested_map` function.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Parameterize a Unit Test
- File: `test_utils.py`
- Description: Implements a `TestAccessNestedMap` class to test the `utils.access_nested_map` function using the `@parameterized.expand` decorator. Tests the function with the following inputs:
  - `nested_map={"a": 1}, path=("a",)` → expects `1`
  - `nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a",)` → expects `{"b": 2}`
  - `nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a", "b")` → expects `2`
- Status: Completed

Additional tasks may involve testing other functions or implementing integration tests, which will be added as they are completed.

This `README.md`:
- Provides a clear project overview, aligning with the unit and integration testing focus.
- Lists the repository and directory as specified (`alx-backend-python`, `0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests`).
- Outlines learning objectives, summarizing the key concepts (unit vs. integration tests, mocking, parameterization, fixtures).
- Details the requirements (Python 3.7, Ubuntu 18.04, `pycodestyle`, documentation, etc.).
- Lists the provided files (`utils.py`, `client.py`, `fixtures.py`) and describes `test_utils.py` based on your completed Task 0.
- Includes setup and test execution instructions.
- References the provided resources for further reading.
- Ends with a newline, as required.

### Next Steps
1. **Create the `README.md` File**:
   - Save the above content in a file named `README.md` at the root of the `0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests` directory.
   - Ensure it’s committed to the `alx-backend-python` repository:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README.md for unit tests project"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Verify the File**:
   - Confirm the file exists in the repository root.
   - Check that it ends with a newline (e.g., using `cat -e README.md` to see a `$` at the end of the last line).
   - Ensure it’s clear and readable when viewed on GitHub.

3. **Continue with Other Tasks**:
   - If you’re working on additional tasks (e.g., testing error cases for `access_nested_map`, mocking functions in `utils.py`, or integration tests with `client.py` and `fixtures.py`), let me know the specific task details, and I’ll provide tailored guidance.
   - For example, if Task 1 involves testing `access_nested_map` for `KeyError` cases, I can extend the `TestAccessNestedMap` class with new parameterized tests using `assertRaises`.

If you need help with other tasks, specific test cases, or further refinements to the `README.md` (e.g., adding more task descriptions as you complete them), please provide the details, and I’ll assist promptly!
